        <h1> My Story </h1>
        <p> 
           I should have never followed the light. It led to a cave where I was cold and wet from the heavy rain. My Great Sword was slowing me down so I had to drop it. It made me sad to leave my partner there. We had been through so many battles together. I finally decided to drop it since I would die of hypothermia, with great weight lifted off my shoulders (literally) I stumbled into the cave putting all my stuff down and flopping on the ground. After resting for 10 minutes I started a fire with some matches I had and started to cook some food. It smelled so good.

 

 The cave started rumbling, apparently a freaking dragon lived in the cave. If I was here ten years ago in this situation,  I would have fled immediately but now "I am Asada Vercingetorix!" The dragon looked confused and then roared. I instantly recognized it. It was one the Butterfly leviathan dragon. That was the one of the screech I heard when my hometown was attacked. I took out my crossbow and shot multiple arrows at the massive leviathan. It easily shot ice spikes at the arrows spraying splinters everywhere. It shot a volley of spikes my way so I rolled away, took out my acid knives and lunged at the beast, stabbed the leviathan's leg and wing since it was an acid knife it was more painful. It wailed in pain and raked it's claws in my shoulders. I ignored the pain and plunged the knives into the beast's heart and it fell dead. I looked at my large wound and bandaged it. I then sat down and drifted into sleep.

 

 

In Dream:

 

Boom! Cannonballs had Shot through the air decimating houses in the way. My house had been hit directly and my father had been instantly killed. My mother's left arm had been torn off due to a large falling plank of wood. She told me I had run as fast as possible. I screamed no but my mom had died to another falling plank. As I am running I hear two loud roars.

 

Dream Ends:

 

 

I shot awake breathing heavily and took time to register what had just happened and tried to ignore it and thought of other things and realized everyone who has fought it before has died. "Then if no one survived, how do we know about them? Whatever, let's not think about that."

 

 I knew scales were very expensive so I would get some money. I skinned the scales off enough for some armor and extra profit. I sliced the horn off and took it for a new Ax. I put everything in a bag and I ran back home. I put the horns and scales for the equipment and took the extra scales for selling. 

I made an insane approximately 100 million yen. I slept like a rich man's sleep. I woke up and looked into real estate. I found a house with a vault for stuff , in my case money. I bought it for a good 1.5 million yen. After I moved in I went back to the cave and found something that I had not seen last time I was here, an egg. I was scared because the egg had cracks. There was a loose baby dragon in this cave where I was standing. Out of the blue something A.K.A a juvenile butterfly leviathan jumped on me. I thought I was dead but it started licking my face. Ugh I thought in my mind. I lifted it up and it was still squirming so I dropped it on the ground and I tried to scare it away but seemed to laugh. I put a silence charm on it and put it in a bag and filled another bag of scales and I went back home. I released it in the basement and went to the market and sold the scales. Apparently they had increased in price so I got 150 million yen . I used 10,000,000 yen to make a pen for the leviathan. I went to check on the leviathan and it was sleeping in MY bed. I had to sleep in IT'S bed, which was actually kind of comfy. In the morning I tried to wake up but the leviathan jumped on me. I had to push it off which made it mad. I gave it some fish which it happily ate. I took it to it's pen. It immediately ran to the pool and jumped in splashing me and everything around it. I decided to take a swim so I changed and jumped into the pool. After hours of getting splashed by a dragon both of us were exhausted. I carried my leviathan out and put it in a large towel. It immediately tried to go to bed but I carried it to the kitchen and put it on the couch and cooked some steak quickly. I gave it the food and it wolfed it down. It walked to the door of my room and bumped the door. I walked over to the door and opened it. I was surprised when it walked to its bed and climbed in and fell asleep almost instantly. I went to the living room and sat on the couch. I started thinking about a name for my leviathan. I decided on Kayda since she was a girl. I stirred up some coffee and sat on the porch and drank it. I went into my backyard and sat in the sunlight finishing my coffee.

 

15 years laterâ€¦

 

" No No NO!!!" I scream as Kayda smashes the ancient glass vase. "Kayda!" I screech. "That was an ancient Greek artifact." 

 

 I told Kayda to go outside and she dragged her feet against the floor and went outside. After approximately 5 seconds she ran back inside looking terrified. I calmed her down and took a look outside. It was the raiders who killed my parents. I went back inside and gave a lavender to Kayda for her to smell. I went back to the main room and flipped the torch down. I told Kayda to stand next to me so she walked to me. The floor started moving down and into my underground warehouse. I went to the armory and took out the dragon armor I have been working on. I put it on the conveyor belt and the amour went to the main room. As I was doing this, Kayda was running around in circles chasing a Moth. I called Kayda over and I started to put the armor on her. I told her to stay still but, unsurprisingly she started fidgeting. I had to use a freeze spell so she would stay still. I put on the armor and broke the spell. Kayda tried to take it off but I stopped her from doing so. I went back to the armory to get the weapons I forged so long ago. I took the equipment ,wore the armor , sharpened the sword and Axe ,and replaced the limb of the crossbow. I attached a sheath to my hip and put my sword in it. I put my Crossbow on my back and I held my weapon of choice, The mighty Axe . I Heard a loud roar. My eyes instantly widened. It was the same dragon that burned down my hometown. I went to Kayda and climbed onto her back. I showed Kayda to the exit and we flew through an exit in the waterfall. We looked at the dragon and it was huge. It was a class 15 Screaming Death. Flying at a staggering 800 feet in length and 300 feet in height. They could shoot fireballs like machine guns. I signaled Kayda to shoot lightning in the air signaling the town there was invaders. The army almost instantly came out and ran to the edge of town. I went to ready the army of whispering deaths, the counterpart of the powerful screaming death. I wake them all up by startling them with a powerful lightning blast. They all went to the soldiers they were trained to. The whispering death were acting funny; they were slowly flying towards the screaming death. We tried to pull back but they threw off the soldiers falling to their deaths. The dragons flew to the screaming death now on its side. I Had to stop this. I Told Kayda to fly around the enemies to flank them. We flew to the side of the enemies and flew behind them. I told Kayda to act like she was possessed. We flew into the enemy line looking like we were possessed. Kayda slowly picked off the Whispering Deaths until there were none left. The screaming death was already at the town by the time I picked them off. It was already obliterating everything in its path when I noticed a light on The Death's neck. I thought nothing of it and told Kayda to roar. *Dragon roar* The screaming death turned around a rose to its full height. IT WAS HUGE!!! Kayda immediately shot lightning at the beast , but it appeared to do nothing to it. Then I remembered the Light on its neck . That light must be its power source. Kayda read my thoughts and shot the light with plasma fire. The Death screamed in pain and whipped it head around and started into our souls. It was just frozen in the air. Its wing weren't even moving. Suddenly it lunged at us shooting fireballs. We Narrowly Dodged them but I was hit when I wasn't looking and I flew off  Kayda. She dived towards me catching me right before I hit the ground. We charged at the Death while it firing fireballs at us. We dodged them skillfully and I saw the light. It was the ghost of my Mother. At first I was confused, I rubbed my eyes. When I opened them again she was still there. I was so surprised that I almost fell off Kayda but I caught my balance. "I had to kill my mother. I had to kill my mother." I thought many times in my head. I was about kill me own mother. I had to do it, hundreds of thousands of people would die. I picked up to courage to strike. I finally commanded Kayda to strike. She Powered up the most powerful lightning blast that she ever blasted. I covered my ears and eyes and she struck the Death went flying and it just vanished into the air
